# Brain

Brain is text bot, currently not working. It will at first utilize an LSTM structure to learn from some text data to produce JSON strings.

The text data will be json arrays of objects of data taken from discord messages.

as time goes on, we will add extra parameters to the json data that is being handed to the bot, such as encapsulating the array in an object that contains some global context.

Some possible global context is:
Mood
Interest
Sentement
